"""
ais/generate_synthetic.py

Generates fake AIS vessel tracks around a spill's estimated origin
point/time — since no real AIS is matched to a real spill event, this
fabricates a plausible traffic scene: several "innocent" vessels
following real headings through the area, and one vessel deliberately
routed close to the origin in both space and time (the intended
"suspect" for the demo).

Track format matches the pipeline contract: [lat, lon, timestamp].
