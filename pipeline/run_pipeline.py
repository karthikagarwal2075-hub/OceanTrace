"""
pipeline/run_pipeline.py

Orchestrates detection -> drift -> AIS into a single JSON output matching
docs/contract.md's shape. This is the one file that turns three separate,
independently-tested modules into the actual end-to-end demo.

Two entry points:
  - run_pipeline()       : original synthetic-PALSAR path (unchanged behavior)
  - run_pipeline_real()  : real Sentinel-1 scene path (new)

Both funnel into _build_pipeline_output(), so drift/AIS logic is identical
either way -- only the detection stage and its region bounds differ.

Run with:
    python -m pipeline.run_pipeline            # synthetic (default, unchanged)
    python -m pipeline.run_pipeline --real      # real Sentinel-1 scene
